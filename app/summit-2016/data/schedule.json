        "desc": "Polymer helps you use the platform to build performant, responsive, delightful web apps. Firebase helps you do it without having to run your own backend infrastructure! Polymer and Firebase have joined forces to put Progressive Web Apps within the reach of mere mortal developers. In this session, you'll learn how to leverage PolymerFire (the official Polymer bindings for Firebase) to handle authentication, data (both online and off), and more in your Polymer application. You'll also learn how you can use Firebase Hosting to deliver your app lightning-fast using the PRPL pattern. Get the tools you need to go from zero to PWA in record time."

Polymer is a library that helps developers realize the potential of the platform to please and delight users. From paradigms to pointers we’ll review a plethora of concepts and examples to make sure you’re prepared to write applications that are truly paragons of performance."

        "name": "An app in 3 days or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the Polymer toolbox",
        "speaker": "Monica Dinculescu",
        "desc": "Think of your favorite app. It's probably meowni.ca/emojillate (who can blame you), but if it isn't (and we need to talk) it probably has one, if not all, of these things: a database; a potential for disaster, with many users looking at and clicking on the same data; offline support, a responsive layout while preferably being faster than the average bear. Recreating this experience from scratch might sound like a terrifying experience, but I'm going to show you how the polymer toolbox and a few other already-built elements can help you go from zero to hero and build a PWA in no time."
