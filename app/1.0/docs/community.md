There are many great resources and communities to learn more about Polymer and web components, share what you've built, and more. All community participation is subject to the Polymer project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md) - be excellent to each other!

* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/polymer) with the `polymer` tag is perfect for any kind of question around developing using the Polymer library.
* [Slack](https://polymer.slack.com/messages) is an active chatroom for quick questions, conversations, sharing and more. Sign up [here](polymer-slack.herokuapp.com) to join.
* Follow [@Polymer](https://twitter.com/polymer) on Twitter for the latest on web components and the Polymer project.
* [polymer-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-dev) email list is great for long-form questions and discussion.
* [polymer-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-announce) email list is a great low-traffic list for following along with the latest major Polymer project announcements.
