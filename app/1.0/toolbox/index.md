Polymer App Toolbox is a collection of components, tools and templates for
building
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps)
with Polymer. App Toolbox features:

-   Component-based architecture using Polymer and web components.
-   Responsive design using the app layout components.
-   Modular routing using the [`<app-route>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route) elements.
-   Localization with [`<app-localization-behavior>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-localization-behavior).
-   Turnkey support for local storage with [`<app-storage>`](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-storage).
-   Offline caching as a progressive enhancement, using service workers.
-   A reference server implementation with support for HTTP2 and HTTP2 push.

You can use any one of these components separately, or use them together to build a full-featured Progressive web app. Most importantly, each component is _additive_. For a simple app you may only need app-layout. As it gets more complicated, you can add routing, offline caching, and a high-performance server as required.

To get a feel for these components in action, you can try out the Shop app. Shop is a full-featured e-commerce Progressive web app built using the Toolbox.
