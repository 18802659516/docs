Polymer is distributed via the [Bower package manager](https://bower.io/). 

To create an application template and install Polymer automatically, you can [use the Polymer CLI](#use-cli).

To start a project from scratch, you can [install Polymer with Bower](#use-bower). 

### Use the Polymer CLI to create an application template and install Polymer {#use-cli}

The Polymer CLI requires Node.js, npm and Bower. For full installation instructions, see [the Polymer CLI documentation](../docs/tools/polymer-cli.md).

1. Install the Polymer CLI.

    ```bash
	npm install -g polymer-cli
	```

2. Verify your Polymer version.

    ```bash
    polymer --version
    ```

    The output of this command should be at least `0.18.0`.

3. Create a test folder for Polymer 2.0, and switch to it.

    ```bash
    mkdir polymer-20-test
    cd polymer-20-test
    ```

4. Initialize your project.

    ```bash
    polymer init
    ```

5. Select `polymer-2-application`.

6. Serve your project.

    ```bash
    polymer serve
    ```

### Install Polymer from Bower {#use-bower}

1. Install Bower.

    ```bash
    npm install -g bower
    ```

    ```

3. Verify your Polymer CLI version.

    ```bash
    polymer --version
    ```

4. Install the latest Polymer 2.0 RC release from bower

    ```bash

    ```

  - `<script src="/bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>` to
  load the polyfills
  - `<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/polymer/polymer.html">` to
  import Polymer

6. Import and use whichever elements youâ€™d like.

7. Serve your project.

    ```bash
    polymer serve
    ```
