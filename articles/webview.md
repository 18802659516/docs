## Introduction

A lot of developers as us how to use {{site.project_title}} in 

[WebView for Android](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/overview)

The first Chromium-powered webview shipped **Android 4.4.3** with version **33.0.0.0**.

Polymer only supports the latest modern browsers. This includes the legacy Android,
which means the legacy Android webview is not supported.

To gain native support for all the web component APIs, be sure to target Android L (SDK version 20).

**Android L Developer Preview**, which ships with Chrome webview **36.0.0.0**.

[Getting Started: WebView-based Applications for Web Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/gettingstarted)

Chrome 36 was the first browser to ship all of the web components APIs, natively.
